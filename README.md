# VulBERTa-reproduction

This repository contains the results of running the code from the research paper titled: 'VulBERTa: Simplified Source Code Pre-Training for Vulnerability Detection'. This research paper introduces a combination of NLP and Deep Learning to detect vulnerabilities in source code. VulBERTa is a great model to detect vulnerabilites in software but has various limitations such as:
- It has only been applied to C/C++ code
- Highly resource intensive and very expensive to train
- Lack of a systematic attempt to detect novel 0-days vulnerabilities in open-source projects in-the-wild

This repository contains:
- src: repository containing all the code of execution of the model
- summary.md: results obtained after the execution of the model
